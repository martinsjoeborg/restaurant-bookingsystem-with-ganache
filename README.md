<p>We made a mock-up restaurant site of the infamous swedish museum "Disgusting food museum" in Malm√∂ for a school project.</p> <br>
<p>The contributers github is: amwallgren, MaxCid and me.</p><br>
<p>On the site you can scroll through the menu, contact the restaurant and book a table.</p><br>
<p>If you type /admin in the URL you will go to the admin page were you can add, edit and delete bookings.</p><br>
<p>To test this project you will need to use ganache and metamask.</p>

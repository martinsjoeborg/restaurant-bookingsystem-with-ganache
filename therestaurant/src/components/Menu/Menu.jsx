            Century eggs, also known as preserved eggs or thousand-year eggs,
            are a Chinese delicacy made by preserving duck, chicken, or quail
            eggs in a mixture of clay, ash, salt, quicklime, and rice straw for
            several weeks to several months, depending on the desired taste and
            texture. The process of preservation causes the egg white to turn a
            translucent brown jelly-like texture, while the yolk becomes a
            greenish-grey, creamy substance with a pungent odor. Century eggs
            have a unique flavor that can be described as salty, slightly sweet,
            and savory with a strong ammonia-like aroma. They are often used as
            an ingredient in savory dishes, such as congee, stir-fries, and
            noodle soups, and are considered a delicacy in many parts of China
            and Southeast Asia. While century eggs may be an acquired taste for
            some, they are a beloved food for many people who grew up eating
            them.

            Cuy, also known as guinea pig, is a traditional dish in some parts
            of South America, particularly in the Andean region of Peru,
            Ecuador, and Bolivia. <br />
            The guinea pig is gutted, cleaned, and seasoned with salt and herbs,{" "}
            <br />
            then roasted whole over an open flame, <br />
            until the skin is crispy and the meat is tender. Cuy is considered a
            delicacy and is often served on special occasions. <br />
            It is said to have a rich flavor, similar to rabbit or dark chicken
            meat.

            Several hundreds of Auks birds undergo a fermentation process by
            being sewn into the body cavity of a seal, <br />
            The fermentation process lasts for several months, with the seal
            skin stored somewhere like under a pile of rocks, <br />
            or in a snowdrift. Due to the bacterial and enzymatic activity,
            these small seabirds undergo a complex process of fermentation.{" "}
            <br />
            The tissue is brokwn down and leaves a strong odor, and even
            stronger taste. Served raw, per tradition, with the feathers and
            beaks removed. This dish is highly a highly priced delicacy in
            Greenland, very rare. Concidered a cultural treasue, and is mostly
            reserved for the most special occations, <br />
            like your first date, or wedding, for example?

            Casu Marzu. A traditional cheese from Sardinia. <br />
            Casu Marzu is illegal in most of europe due to its one of a kind
            making process. <br />
            It's made from sheeps milk, that is deliberately inflected with
            larvae to break down the fat in it <br />
            This is the secret to making the cheese soft and more purgent.{" "}
            <br />
            The larves have a tencency to jump, and can sometimes blind the
            consumer of the cheese by getting in their eyes. For this reason,{" "}
            <br />
            the cheese is not concidered safe for consumption, <br />
            and is illegal in most of EU. <br />
            how fresh the cheese is, is measured of the health of the jumping
            larves inside of it, if theyre dead, the cheese is no good <br />
            We, of course, only focus on maintaining the highest standard,{" "}
            <br />
            and will therefore always serve our Casu Marzu in the most fresh
            condition. <br />

            Classic Lobster dish for our guests that want to play it safe.{" "}
            <br />
            This dish, however, has not always been a delicacy. <br />
            During the Americal Colonial era, lobsters were concidered the poor
            mans food, <br />
            and would mostly be served to prisoners. The prisoners complaints
            eventually got to the point <br />
            that it was included in their contracts to not serve lobster more
            than three times per week. <br />
            Today, lobsters have become more of a luxury item, so enjoy!

            Escargot snails. According to legend, this dish was popularized by
            the French monks, <br />
            since the Chatolic Churn prohibited consumtion of meat suring
            fasting periods. Monks began to eat snails as a substitute, since
            God for some reason didn't concider snails meat. <br />
            And therefore the monks did not break their fasts. Out Escargots are
            served with butter, white bread and white wine as an appetizer.{" "}
